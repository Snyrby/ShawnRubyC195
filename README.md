Created an appointment system database and associated UI. The database was 
MySQL. The system was able to create, modify and delete appointments for users and included logic to prevent users 
from being deleted if they had active appointments. UI showed appointment times in the userâ€™s time zone. Database also 
stored login information for users of the program. **** The database is no longer available as it was used on a Virtual Machine created by my school ****
